# üê¶ Bird Classifier with fastai  

Trained a ResNet18 model to classify birds using DuckDuckGo images, as part of [fast.ai Lesson 1](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html).  

## Key Features  
- **Dataset**: Scraped bird/non-bird images using DuckDuckGo Search  
- **Model**: `fastai`'s `vision_learner` with ResNet18 backbone  
- **Accuracy**: Achieved ~95% validation accuracy (may vary based on dataset)  

## How to Use  
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab:
